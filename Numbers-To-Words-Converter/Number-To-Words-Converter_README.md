# Number to Words Converter (1-100)

This Python program converts numbers (1 to 100) into words. It takes user input, checks the dictionary for predefined names, and prints the number in words.

## 🚀 Features
- Converts numbers from **1 to 100** into words.
- Handles both direct matches and two-part numbers (e.g., **42 → forty-two**).
- Simple and beginner-friendly code.

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. The user inputs a number between **1 and 100**.
2. The program checks if the number is in the dictionary.
3. If not, it breaks the number into **tens and units** and finds their word equivalents.
4. It prints the number in words.

## 📜 Example Output
```bash
Enter a Number: 42
42 in words is forty two

Enter a Number: 90
90 in words is ninety

Enter a Number: 105
Error! Enter a number from 1 to 100
