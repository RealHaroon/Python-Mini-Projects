# 🎯 Guess The Number

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10.
2. The player enters their guess.
3. The program provides hints:
   - "Too High" if the guess is greater than the number.
   - "Too Low" if the guess is smaller than the number.
4. The game continues until the player guesses correctly.
5. The program displays the number of attempts taken.
